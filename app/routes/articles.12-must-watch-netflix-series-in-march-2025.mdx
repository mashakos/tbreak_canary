Instead of relying on typical superhero tropes, the show takes inspiration from mythic archetypes, offering a unique twist on the concept of superpowers. The protagonists embark on a mission to confront the scientist responsible for their transformations, weaving a compelling tale of self-discovery and confrontation.

The storyline reimagines gene therapy as a modern-day monstrous evolution, where extraordinary powers emerge as strange and unsettling mutations rather than classic heroic traits. *Future Imperfect* continues March’s trend of delivering engaging content with a distinctive take on genetic experimentation and its consequences.
