It’s 2023, and phones once sold at flagship prices that would cost you a month’s salary are now available at an affordable price. Older mobile phones and even new mid-range smartphones that can compete with flagships of the past from the same manufacturer can easily be purchased below AED 2000 (US$ 550.)

The fact that [overall smartphone shipments are slipping](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-smartphone-market-lowest-q3-level-since-2014/) works towards the consumer (you and me) as manufacturers need your attention. This means that it’s a good time to look into mid-range smartphones.

I have put together the best smartphones under 2000 Dirhams in the UAE in this list. If you feel that AED 2,000 is too much to spend on a phone, head to our guide on the [best smartphone under 1000 AED](https://tbreak.com/tech/best-phones-under-1000-aed/).

Honestly, the list of phones below is quite impressive, and though you won’t necessarily find the [latest iPhone Pro Max phone here](https://tbreak.com/tech/iphone-14-pro-max-specs-price/), there is an iPhone on this list that’s not too old.

But Android is where you see most of the competition regarding mid-range mobiles. If you know you want an Android and can spend a bit more, you should also check out the [best android phones](https://tbreak.com/tech/best-android-phones/) list.

I’ve reworked this list based on the phone’s pricing by dividing it into two: phones that are between AED 1500-2000 and phones below AED 1500 down to AED 1000. I’ve done this so you can further define your budget and, based on that, compare and pick a phone easily. Also, there is no shortage in the number of phones available in each budget range and over time, this list might get separated into two.

## Best phones under 2000 AED

- [1. Samsung Galaxy S22](#1-samsung-galaxy-s-22)
- [2. Honor 70](#2-honor-70)
- [3. Apple iPhone 11](#3-apple-i-phone-11)
- [4. Huawei Nova 10](#4-huawei-nova-10)
- [1. Poco X5 Pro](#1-poco-x-5-pro)
- [2. Nothing Phone (1)](#2-nothing-phone-1)
- [3. Xiaomi 12T](#3-xiaomi-12-t)
- [4. Oppo Reno 8T 5G Dual SIM](#4-oppo-reno-8-t-5-g-dual-sim)

## The best smartphones in Dubai between AED 1,500 to AED 2,000

While I do my best to keep this list updated, the fluctuating pricing could mean that, at some point, one or more of these phones goes past the AED 2,000 mark. That’s likely a temporary hike, and chances are the phone will come back to its market price.

### 1. Samsung Galaxy S22

When it comes to choosing the best phones under AED 2,000, the Samsung Galaxy S22 is our pick.

### 2. Honor 70

Honor is in the process of relaunching itself after detaching from Huawei and if the Honor 70 is anything to go by, the company is in good shape. This beautifully designed phone with a gorgeous screen costs a lot lower than it looks and comes with decent specs for a mid-range product.

### 3. Apple iPhone 11

You can’t really have a phone roundup with an iPhone, and considering the price ceiling, the iPhone 11 is your best bet. While old, it’s still a very fast phone offering the full-screen experience as most new iPhones now. There’s the [iPhone SE](https://www.amazon.ae/dp/B09V4CLRF4/ref=redir_mobile_desktop?tag=tbreaktech-21&ref_=sbx_be_s_sparkle_lsi4d_asin_2_img) as well, with newer specs but a more dated design with the home button if that’s still your thing.

[![Apple iPhone 11](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/419VeNTE4mL._SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.ae/dp/B07Y3KQ1XV?tag=tbreaktech-21 "Apple iPhone 11")

### 4. Huawei Nova 10

Huawei has been pushing the boundaries of phone designs and prices for some time now, and its no surprise to find the manufacturer on this list. The Nova 10 is their latest affordable phone with a gorgeous design and an excellent selfie camera.

[![Huawei Nova 10](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41FHDK3FRBL._SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.ae/dp/B0BHJDJB7N?tag=tbreaktech-21 "Huawei Nova 10")

## Mobile Phones between AED 1,000 to AED 1,500

Below you’ll find phones between AED 1000 to AED 1499, and chances are some of them might dip below the AED 1,000 mark during a sale period. I’d highly recommend purchasing a phone in this list selling below AED 1,000 as that is a tremendous value.

### 1. Poco X5 Pro

For mobile phones under AED 1,500, the Poco X5 Pro tops the list with almost everything you would want from an affordable phone. It has a speedy processor with a large and beautiful OLED screen with fast refresh rates.

The 5,000 mAh battery should keep the phone going for a long time while the 67W wired charging capabilities will top up the battery quickly. It’s no surprise that the Poco X5 Pro sits as the best smartphone under AED 1,500.

### 2. Nothing Phone (1)

We were always fans of OnePlus phones because of their fast performance and clean version of Android at a great price point. Sadly the company lost that vision and their co-founder who has now started a new company called Nothing. The first phone by Nothing is outstanding as an affordable phone and makes us excited to see what else is coming.

[![Nothing Phone (1)](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Mgbh0v0GL._SL500_.jpg)](https://www.amazon.ae/dp/B09Z6R6C7C?tag=tbreaktech-21 "Nothing Phone (1)")

## Bottom Line

We’ve picked a good selection of phones that cost under AED 2,000 or under AED 1,500. If your budget is close to AED 2,000, the [Samsung Galaxy S22](https://www.amazon.ae/Samsung-Android-Smartphone-Phantom-Version/dp/B09RQVF68G/ref=sr_1_5?tag=tbreaktech-21) is a fantastic phone but if you’re more of an iPhone person then we recommend the [iPhone 11](https://www.amazon.ae/Apple-iPhone-11-64GB-Purple/dp/B07Y3KQ1XV/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?tag=tbreaktech-21).

If you want to stay closer to AED 1,500 then we recommend the [Poco X5 Pro](https://tbreak.com/amzn-poco-x5-pro-5g-blue-8gb-ram-256-storage-120hz-poled-display-snapdragon-778g-processor-67w-turbo-charging-108mp-pro-grade-camera/) as well as [Nothing Phone (1)](https://www.amazon.ae/Nothing-Phone-Interface-camera-display/dp/B09Z6R6C7C?tag=tbreaktech-21&ref_=as_li_ss_tl) as excellent phones that offer features and performance closer to phones that cost more.
