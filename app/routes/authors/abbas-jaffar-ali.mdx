about: >-
  Abbas has been covering tech for more than two decades- before phones became
  smart or clouds stored data. He brought publications like CNET, TechRadar and
  IGN to the Middle East. From computers to mobile phones and watches, Abbas is
  always interested in tech that is smarter and smaller because he believes that
  tech shouldn't be something that gets added to your life- it should be a part
  of your life.
